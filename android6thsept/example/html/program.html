                <p>Algorithms play the central role both in the science and practice of computing.
                    Recognition of this fact has led to the appearance of a considerable number
                    of textbooks on the subject. By and large, they follow one of two alternatives
                    in presenting algorithms. One classifies algorithms according to a problem type.
                    Such a book would have separate chapters on algorithms for sorting, searching,
                    graphs, and so on. The advantage of this approach is that it allows an immediate
                    comparison of, say, the efficiency of different algorithms for the same problem.
                    The drawback of this approach is that it emphasizes problem types at the expense
                    of algorithm design techniques.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the traditional classification of algorithm design techniques has several serious shortcomings, from both theoretical and educational points
                    of view. The most significant of these shortcomings is the failure to classify many important algorithms. This limitation has forced the authors of other textbooks
                    to depart from the design technique organization and to include chapters dealing with specific problem types. Such a switch leads to a loss of course coherence and
                    almost unavoidably creates a confusion in students’ minds.</p>

                <p>My frustration with the shortcomings of the traditional classification of algorithm
                    design techniques has motivated me to develop a new taxonomy of them [Lev99],
                    which is the basis of this book. Here are the principal advantages of the new
                    taxonomy:</p>
